## :wave: Greetings!

I’m `𝐓𝐮𝐚𝐧`, and I find coding is similar to solving a puzzle :dart:. Sometimes it's a headache but when it finishes it looks *really* amazing. :sparkles:

What's the icing on the cake :cupcake: for me is that I've been an actual developer for now over many years and the power of creating simple fixes for complex problems, yet it just works and is pretty useful.

Since I was at university for a few years before I started taking a self-learning journey :books:.

I enjoy keeping things clear and easy, both when I sharing ideas or work with others :handshake:. By doing so, I make tough ideas simple for everyone to get.

Starting right matters to me because it cuts down on time and stress down the road. :rainbow:
